## About

opensurgbot aims to be an open-source, low-cost, easy-to-use and easy-to-improve surgical robot platform, compatible with the [SurRoL](https://github.com/med-air/SurRoL) framework.

The first prototype has been successfully built and tested.

## Installation and usage

- Please refer to [opensurgbot_pipeline/tree/main/STM32CubeIDE_projects](https://github.com/lgabp1/opensurgbot_pipeline/STM32CubeIDE_projects) (based on [DM-MC02_drivers](https://github.com/lgabp1/DM-MC02_drivers) and [ZDT stm32 driver](github.com/lgabp1/zdt_stm32_driver)) to setup the STM32 microcontroller.
- Please refer to [(no link yet)]() and [(no link yet)]() for the hardware setup. The optional [opensurgbot_board](https://github.com/lgabp1/opensurgbot_board/) can be used to simplify the wiring.

As for the software,
- Please refer to [opensurgbot_pipeline](https://github.com/lgabp1/opensurgbot_pipeline/) to use the high level python API.
- Please refer to [opensurgbot_SurRoL](https://github.com/lgabp1/opensurgbot_SurRoL/) for the integration with the SurRoL framework.
